# Expression_Evaluator

Implementation of Linked Lists on arrays, emulating a language where pointers aren't available.

Simple and double Linked Lists on array implementation, of queue and stack.

Tests for correct implementation of queue included.

Stack has been used for the Expression_Evaluator, specifically for the infix to postfix transformation and after that for the evaluation of the postfix expression.
Stack works on strings only and Queue works on int defined as TElem.
