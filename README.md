# Expression_Evaluator

Implementation of Linked Lists on arrays, like in a language where pointers aren't available.
Simple and double Linked Lists on array implementation, of queue and stack.
Test for correct implementation of queue included.
Stack has been used for the Expression_Evaluator, specifically for the infix to postfix transformation and after that for the evaluation of the postfix expression.
